# Contact Tracing API/COVID-19 apps (Prominent Disclosure & Privacy Policy) on Play
This guide is geared towards publishing apps using **`CONTACT TRACING API`** or apps that **`involves COVID-19/coronavirus`** on Google Play Store.

For now, the guide focuses on the **`Prominent Disclosure`** & **`Privacy Policy`** Requirements of the store.


## Prominent Disclosure
1. Depending on the data accessed via each permissions, developers would require a prominent disclosure mentioning the `data accessed` & the purposes of it.

2. Disclosure must be presented **`before` the relevant permissions** and `cannot be skipped/cancelled` if the permissions are going to be requested.


- For example:
  - `Image via READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
     - "Our app accesses **Image** for **uploading ID for verification**"
     - This would be sufficient, with **Image** being the data & **uploading ID for verification** being the purposes.

  - `Video via WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
    - "We may allow uploading **videos** for **recording quarantine condition**" 
     - This would also be sufficient, with **videos** being the data & **recording quarantine condition** being the purposes.

## Privacy Policy
1. Privacy policy **must** always be available on 2 locations:
    1. Play Store itself
    2. In-app experience (**Must be accessible after signing-in**)

2. The privacy policy **should always** mention COVID-19 in any way. Regardless if it is to **purchase COVID-19 test kits**, **check-in to prevent the spread of COVID-19**, or **uploading COVID-19 test results**. Mentioning COVID-19 will ensure it is the app is ready for publishing.

## Rejected App
1. If the app has been rejected/pending rejection, the email will mention the kind of data that needs to be disclosed.

2. Ensure that the app privacy policy mentions the data from the rejection email, and the purposes of it.

3. Ensure that there is a `disclosure` mentioning the data **`BEFORE`** the permissions dialog, and is not skippable.
